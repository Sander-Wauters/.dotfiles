# Sanders dotfiles

Based on Luke Smith <https://lukesmith.xyz>'s dotfiles.
All keybindings have been changed for use with the "azert" keyboard layout (I know, sue me).

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
  - nvim (text editor)
  - zsh (shell)
  - lf (file manager)
  - mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
  - nsxiv (image/gif viewer)
  - mpv (video player)
  - other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
  - All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
  - Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
- Bookmarks in text files used by various scripts (like `~/.local/bin/shortcuts`)
  - File bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
  - Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`
